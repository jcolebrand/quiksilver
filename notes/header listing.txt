a route is a path and a verb.
all paths may accept any number of verbs
paths should be queryable for what verbs they accept and what verbs they don't
paths should be defined before verbs

   The 204 response code is used because the response does not carry a
   message body (which a response with the 200 code would have).  Note
   that other success codes could be used as well.


HEAD     Asks for the response identical to the one that would correspond to a GET request, but without the response body. This is useful for retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without having to transport the entire content.
GET      Requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET (and a few other HTTP methods) "SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval".[1] The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, "Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations."[12] See safe methods below.
POST     Submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both.
PUT      Uploads a representation of the specified resource.
DELETE   Deletes the specified resource.
TRACE    Echoes back the received request, so that a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediate servers.
OPTIONS  Returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for specified URL. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.
CONNECT  Converts the request connection to a transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted communication (HTTPS) through an unencrypted HTTP proxy.[13]
PATCH    Is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.[14]
HTTP servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods[15] and, whenever possible, also the OPTIONS method.[citation needed]
