Welcome to Quiksilver
===========

This is probably not a viable project for you to fork.
---------------

Remember that I told you that later.

This project is for me to learn with. I plan on doing some crazy things, and changing stuff.

But it will be fun for me to learn about node.js this way. And should make me a better programmer in the long run.

There's a crapton of files in here. They don't really mean anything yet. I'm just accumulating knowledge and learning stuff. Give me time to develop my own feelings on things. I have some organizational structures in mind and will organize this stuff soon enough.



Regarding the certificate public/private pair. 
----------------
Guess what, it was self generated. I can generate another one. You can be a douche and goof with them. This is a learning repo. I don't give two shits. When I need them I'll get a signed public cert and store it in a safe location (not a publicly available DVCS repo)
